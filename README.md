# Advent of Code 2018

This is my first year doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. I'm not trying to
do anything more than complete all the challenges, do them in a timely manner - meaning before the next
one starts, and learn some along the way.

I have a [challenge diary](diary.md) that you can read through if you so care. It may not be complete or
up to date. I will eventually fill it all in.
