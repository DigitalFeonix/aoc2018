# TODO

- [ ] Reorganize the structure of the repo
- [ ] Refactor/cleanup all the solutions
- [ ] Add Diary
- [ ] Move common functions (eg; read order sort) and classes (eg: Vector) into "global" library
  - [ ] Add autoloader to make getting those classes easier
- [ ] Add script to build skeleton for each day (perhaps also grab the input from the server)
